            Hunger in Bangladesh is one of the major issues that affects the
            citizens. In Bangladesh 40% of the country falls under three
            categories: hunger, starvation and chronic hunger.

            A house is a place where a man lives. A house can be used for other
            purposes, but usually, housing means to provide dwelling place to
            men. Housing is one of the basic needs of men.

          In the half-century since people visited the Moon, NASA has continued
          to push the boundaries of knowledge to deliver on the promise of
          American ingenuity and leadership in space. And NASA will continue
          that work by moving forward to the Moon with astronauts landing on the
          lunar South Pole by 2024. NASA is continuing its research to make
          supersonic aircraft -- which generate loud booms as they go slow down
          below the speed of sound -- quieter and more amenable to flying in
          populated areas. The X-59, or QUESST, aircraft passed a major review
          milestone in 2019,
